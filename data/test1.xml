            <h>First International and the Paris Commune</h>
            <p>
                In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <link target="revolutions of 1848">revolutions of 1848</link>,
                during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out
                nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, <link
                    target="conservative">conservative
            </link> elements took advantage of the divided groups of <link target="Socialism">socialists</link>, <link
                    target="Liberalism">liberals
            </link> and <link target="Nationalism">nationalists</link> along with anarchists to prevent further revolt.
                In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruña in 1845 which was
                inspired by Proudhon&apos;s ideas.
            </p>
            <p>In 1864, the <link target="International Workingmen&amp;apos;s Association">International Workingmen&amp;apos;s
                Association
            </link> (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French

            </p>
            <p>Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: &quot;The annual Congress of the International had not taken
                place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a
                special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a
                technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting
                Bakunin&apos;s Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General
                Council&apos;s resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin
                and his followers&quot;.

            <p>The <link target="Anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarian</link> sections of the First International
                were the precursors of the <link target="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalists</link>, seeking to
                &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous
                organization of labour&quot;. In 1886, the <link

                    Labor Unions

                </link> would become standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response, unions across the United States prepared a <link target="general strike">general strike
            </link> in support of the event. On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when <link target="strikebreaker">
                strikebreaker</link>s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire
                upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago&apos;s Haymarket Square. A
                bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing
                panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers
                were killed.

            <h>Propaganda of the deed and illegalism</h>
            <p>
                Some anarchists, such as <link target="Johann Most">Johann Most</link>, advocated publicising violent
                acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for
                itself, but also action as propaganda&quot;. Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not
                advocacy of mass murder, but <link target="targeted killings">targeted killings</link> of members of the <link
                    target="ruling class">ruling class
            </link> at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of
                heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself
                once boasted that &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the
                annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion&quot;.
                Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885, The Science of Revolutionary Warfare, a how-to
                manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives
                plant in New Jersey.
            </p>
            <p>By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda
                of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, <link target="regicide">regicide</link>s and <link
                        target="tyrannicide">tyrannicide</link>s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these
                anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal &quot;<link

                A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s.
                Anarchism was influential in the <link target="Counterculture of the 1960s">Counterculture of the

                movement in the form of <link target="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</link>, they returned with

                is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so

                began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated
                with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous
                order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where
                order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot; and where &quot;business
                transactions alone produce the social order.&quot; Proudhon distinguished between ideal political
                possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical
                statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French
                parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers&apos;
                movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned <link

                According to the American mutualist <link target="William Batchelder Greene">William Batchelder
                    Greene</link>, each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his

                discount&quot;. Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between
                individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third
                form of society, the synthesis of communism and property&quot;.

    <article name="Autism">
        <content>
            <p>Autism is a <link target="developmental disorder">developmental disorder</link> characterized by troubles
                with <link target="social interaction">social interaction</link> and <link target="communication">
                    communication
                </link> and by restricted and repetitive <link target="behavior">behavior</link>. Parents usually notice
                signs in the first two or three years of their child&apos;s life. However, there is increasing suspicion
                that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
            </p>
            <p>Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <link target="Heritability of autism">genetics of
                autism
            </link> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <link target="mutation">
                mutation</link>s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants.
                However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism
                cannot be traced to a <link target="Mendelian">Mendelian</link> (single-gene) mutation or to a
                single <link target="chromosome abnormality">chromosome abnormality</link>, and none of the genetic
                syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have
                been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually
                explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family
                members may result from spontaneous <link target="structural variation">structural variation</link> —
                such as <link target="Deletion (genetics)">deletions</link>, <link target="Gene duplication">

                </link> or <link target="Chromosomal inversion">inversions</link> in genetic material during <link
                        target="meiosis">meiosis</link>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable
                to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the
                autism is not present in the parental genome. parental concern about a potential vaccine link with
                autism has led to lower rates of <link target="childhood immunizations">childhood immunizations</link>, <link

                </link> of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought
                that activation of a pregnant mother&apos;s immune system such as from environmental toxicants or
                infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. No single
                treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child&apos;s needs. Families and the
                educational system are the main resources for treatment. Studies of interventions have methodological
                problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <link target="efficacy">efficacy</link>, however the
                development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. The evidence for early
                intensive behavioral intervention is low. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood
                intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP).
                One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement
                various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various
                DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent
                implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have
                demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of
                treatment.

            </link> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children
                Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a
                report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for
                children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the
                effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including
                children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a
                subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

                <h>Medication</h>
                Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or
                school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <link

                anticonvulsant</link>s, with the most common drug classes being <link target="antidepressant">

                antipsychotic</link>s. Antipsychotics, such as <link target="risperidone">risperidone</link> and <link
                    target="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</link>, have been found to be useful for treating irritability,
                repetitive behavior, and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism, however their side effects must be
                weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. There is scant
                reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with
                ASD. No known medication relieves autism&apos;s core symptoms of social and communication impairments.
                Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating
                gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to
                cause autism. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the
                cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.
            </p>
            <p>Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism,
                the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and
                use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than
                with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm,
                and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.
                Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the
                occurrence of autism.
            </p>
            <p>Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:
                <link target="Genetic disorder">Genetic disorder</link>s. About 10–15% of autism cases have an
                identifiable <link target="Mendelian">Mendelian</link> (single-gene) condition, <link
                        target="chromosome abnormality">chromosome abnormality</link>, or other genetic syndrome, and
                ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.
                <link target="Intellectual disability">Intellectual disability</link>. The percentage of autistic
                individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to
                70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism
                spectrum. In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker, and by
                definition, the diagnosis of Asperger&apos;s excludes intellectual disability.
                <link target="Anxiety disorder">Anxiety disorder</link>s are common among children with ASD; there are
                no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have

                children with striking behavioral similarities. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term
                independently of Asperger. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was
                labeled as &quot;case 1&quot;. parents continue to feel <link target="social stigma">social stigma

            <p>It took until 1980 for the <link target="DSM-III">DSM-III</link> to differentiate autism from childhood
                schizophrenia. In 1987, the <link target="DSM-III-R">DSM-III-R</link> provided a checklist for
                diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the <link target="DSM-5">DSM-5</link> was released, updating the
                classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including <link

            <p>The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find
