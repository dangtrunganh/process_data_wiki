<p>Anarchism is a <link target="political philosophy">political philosophy</link>   that advocates <link target="Self-governance">self-governed</link> societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as <link target="Stateless society">stateless societies</link>,    although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-<link target="Hierarchy">hierarchical</link> or <link target="Free association (communism and anarchism)">free associations</link>.     Anarchism holds the <link target="State (polity)">state</link> to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. According to <link target="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</link>, Godwin was &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;  while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <link target="Edmund Burke">Edmund Burke</link>.</p>
<p>Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as <link target="philosophical anarchism">philosophical anarchism</link>. He argued in <link target="Political Justice">Political Justice</link> (1793) and Proudhon himself.</p>

<h>First International and the Paris Commune</h>
<p>
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <link target="revolutions of 1848">revolutions of 1848</link>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, <link target="conservative">conservative</link> elements took advantage of the divided groups of <link target="Socialism">socialists</link>, <link target="Liberalism">liberals</link> and <link target="Nationalism">nationalists</link> along with anarchists to prevent further revolt. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon&apos;s ideas.</p>
<p>In 1864, the <link target="International Workingmen&amp;apos;s Association">International Workingmen&amp;apos;s Association</link> (sometimes called the First International) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, <link target="Blanquism">Blanquists</link>, <link target="Philadelphes">Philadelphes</link>, English trade unionists, socialists and <link target="Social democracy">social democrats</link>. Due to its links to active workers&apos; movements, the International became a significant organisation. <link target="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</link> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon&apos;s followers, the <link target="Mutualism (economic theory)">mutualists</link>, opposed Marx&apos;s <link target="state socialism">state socialism</link>, advocating political <link target="abstentionism">abstentionism</link> and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the <link target="Individualist anarchism in the United States">American individualist anarchists</link> <link target="Lysander Spooner">Lysander Spooner</link> and <link target="William Batchelder Greene">William Batchelder Greene</link> had been members of the First International.</p>
<p>Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports: &quot;The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin&apos;s Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council&apos;s resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers&quot;.</p>
<h>Organised labour</h>
<p>The <link target="Anti-authoritarianism">anti-authoritarian</link> sections of the First International were the precursors of the <link target="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalists</link>, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labour&quot;. In 1886, the <link target="Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</link> of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 as the date by which the <link target="Eight-hour day">eight-hour work day</link> would become standard.</p>
<p>
In response, unions across the United States prepared a <link target="general strike">general strike</link> in support of the event. On 3 May, a fight broke out in Chicago when <link target="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</link>s attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day on 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago&apos;s Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed.</p>

<h>Propaganda of the deed and illegalism</h>
<p>
Some anarchists, such as <link target="Johann Most">Johann Most</link>, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda&quot;. Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but <link target="targeted killings">targeted killings</link> of members of the <link target="ruling class">ruling class</link> at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that &quot;the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion&quot;. Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885, The Science of Revolutionary Warfare, a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.</p>
<p>By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, <link target="regicide">regicide</link>s and <link target="tyrannicide">tyrannicide</link>s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal &quot;<link target="Confiscation">expropriations</link>&quot;. <link target="Illegalism">Illegalism</link> as a practice emerged and within it &quot; he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;<link target="propaganda by the deed">propaganda by the deed</link>&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;<link target="individual reappropriation">individual reappropriation</link>&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt&quot;. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <link target="International of Anarchist Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</link>.</p>
<h>Conflicts with European fascist regimes</h>
<p>
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of <link target="fascism in Europe">fascism in Europe</link> transformed anarchism&apos;s conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and <link target="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</link>&apos;s <link target="Fascism">fascists</link>. Italian anarchists played a key role in the <link target="Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</link> organisation <link target="Arditi del Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</link>, which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling <link target="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</link> in the anarchist stronghold of <link target="Parma">Parma</link> in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist Luigi Fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution&quot;.  In France, where the <link target="far-right leagues">far-right leagues</link> came close to insurrection in the <link target="6 February 1934 crisis">February 1934 riots</link>, anarchists divided over a <link target="united front">united front</link> policy.</p>
<p><link target="Anarchism in France">Anarchists in France</link> and <link target="Anarchism in Italy">Italy</link> were active in the <link target="Resistance during World War II">Resistance during World War II</link>. In Germany, the anarchist <link target="Erich Mühsam">Erich Mühsam</link> was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the <link target="Reichstag fire">Reichstag fire</link> in Berlin. <link target="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</link>, the <link target="Nazi Party">Nazi</link> <link target="Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda">propaganda minister</link>, labelled him as one of &quot;those Jewish subversives&quot;. Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at <link target="Sonnenburg">Sonnenburg</link>, Brandenburg and finally, <link target="Oranienburg">Oranienburg</link>. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the <link target="Nazi concentration camps">concentration camp</link> at <link target="Oranienburg concentration camp">Oranienburg</link> when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning. and in 1946 the <link target="Japanese Anarchist Federation">Japanese Anarchist Federation</link> was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the <link target="Fraye Arbeter Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</link> detailing the plight of <link target="Anarchism in Germany">German anarchists</link> and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, Die Freie Gesellschaft, which survived until 1953. In 1956, the <link target="Uruguayan Anarchist Federation">Uruguayan Anarchist Federation</link> was founded. In 1955, the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the <link target="Argentine Libertarian Federation">Argentine Libertarian Federation</link>. The <link target="Syndicalist Workers&amp;apos; Federation">Syndicalist Workers&amp;apos; Federation</link> (SWF) was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.</p>
<p>Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as <link target="Albert Camus">Albert Camus</link>, <link target="Herbert Read">Herbert Read</link>, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, <link target="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</link>, George Woodcock, <link target="Leopold Kohr">Leopold Kohr</link>,</p>
